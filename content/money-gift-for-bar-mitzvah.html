        <p>Do you give a gift at a bar mitzvah? At the age of 12 for girls and 13 for boys (in some communities boys and girls both celebrate at age 13), a bar or bat mitzvah can become easily sidetracked by things. Tendr makes giving a cash gift simple and hassle free. You&#039;ll be encouraging another teenager to go out and buy more stuff when they can be saving that money for their future. The amount given per child should be between two or four chai.</p>

        <p>This is so that the mitzvah boy or girl can stay grounded in the moment of the celebration and to what it truly means. It&#039;s all described in detail on faith, trust, and pixie dust. A big balloon filled with bills and confetti is a festive way to present a monetary gift. You&#039;ll be encouraging another teenager to go out and buy more stuff when they can be saving that money for their future. Any type of jewish young or girl would be proud come wear a necklace the symbolizes something systematic in jewish culture.</p>
