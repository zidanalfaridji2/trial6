I found a solution to get the value from all those cards onto my bank account. No cash or atm access. If, for example, your visa gift card balance is below $10, you should know it. It would be nice if there were “combine gift card apps” that would let you combine balances from a few different cards into one bigger balance that you could use to shop with, but sadly that’s not an option.</p>
