        <p>Cards may be declined by the card issuer or venmo for funds availability or fraud prevention reasons. Venmo is another app that works just like paypal and it allows you to add your visa gift card balance to your venmo account, too. Can you turn a visa gift card into cash? Give out the visa gift card as a gift. You cannot transfer funds from your venmo.</p>

        <p>How do i get cash from a prepaid visa card? Add money to your paypal or venmo account; You can then add money to your venmo balance in the app. I have tried so many ways, and failed, to get my visa digital card balance to transfer to my bank account so i can use it in regular stores without paying $5 and waiting 2 more weeks for the physical card to be mailed. Open a venmo app for yourself;</p>
