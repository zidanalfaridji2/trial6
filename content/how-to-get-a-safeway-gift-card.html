        <p>If the recipient is you—click on who is the gift card for and select for me. When the card requirement was still in place, shoppers could also input the phone number associated with the account at the cash register to get the discount. Chat on aarp said to get a friend to go to safeway but that&#039;s not the point here. In addition, you’ll receive 1% cash back on safeway gift cards, which are available in $25, $75 and $100 denominations. *there is no fee for cash reloads at safeway locations for any everyday select rewards prepaid visa card.</p>
