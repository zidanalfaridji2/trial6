        <p>Mirabel est dotée du pouvoir de la magie du madrigal dans son ensemble. However, encanto puts a twist on it by not calling mirabel the brains. As it always follows her command regardless of what the other family members instruct. I think the grandma&#039;s gift is the house. Mirabel madrigal would not get a present in encanto, and a small element could lastly clarify why.in disney’s encanto, mirabel madrigal (stephanie beatriz) is the one little one within the family madrigal that does not get a magical reward.</p>
