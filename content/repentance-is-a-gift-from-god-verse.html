God “commands all people everywhere to repent” (acts 17:30). First, repentance could be an actual gift of god, but like other gifts, it must be received to be enjoyed. </p>
					<p> In acts 11:18, we read that “to the gentiles also god has granted repentance that leads to life.”. So repentance is vitally important for living life with god and with each other the way life was meant to be lived, but repentance is not one of the conditions for receiving eternal life from god.

Two requisites of repentance included in the sub are to turn from evil, and to turn to the good. most critical theologically is the idea of returning to god, or turning away from evil. This verse shows us that god invests in us, even when we sin, and our duty is to repent with sincerity. </p>
					<p> For example, in mark 1:15, jesus commands to “repent, and believe in the gospel.”. In acts 17:30, paul says that “god commands all men everywhere to repent.”. And you will receive the gift of the holy spirit.
