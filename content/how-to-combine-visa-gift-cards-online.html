        <p>If you are entering the gift card into the correct field on the website, then it is possible the gift card is being rejected for another reason. Use a reloadable card to pay bills, shop online &amp; access your money anytime. As hockeycanuckjc mentioned, we can process multiple gift cards at once. What kind of gift cards are they? I don&#039;t have a credit card but have these 2 x $75 each prepaid visa credit cards so i thought i might as well use those. We would like the entry field to remain so multiple gift cards can be entered.</p>
	<h3>We Mentioned Things Like Using Them To Pay Bills, But You Can Also Give Them As A Present.</h3>
        			<p> <strong>How to combine visa gift cards online</strong>.  Then pick the big reveal. I hope i was able to help clear this up! What kind of gift cards are they? Walmart, for instance, only allows 4 gift cards per order. We mentioned things like using them to pay bills, but you can also give them as a present. </p>
					<p> We believe multiple gift card entry is supported by shopify and will work if the field remains static. The tricky thing about using visa gift cards online. Gift card mall is among the largest gift card sites online that allow you to buy a virtual visa gift card with paypal. In fact, these days i just throw any visa/mastercard/american express gift on there right away regardless of value. You can request money on paypal to another email and use. </p>
					<p> Fortunately, you can indeed use multiple amazon gift cards on one purchase. Lol, not true at all. Each issuing bank also sets the terms and conditions for that particular card, as well as the method for activating it. Visa may receive compensation from the card issuers whose cards appear on the website, but makes no representations about the accuracy or completeness of any information. For instance, if you know your visa gift card balance is below $10.00, you may have a hard time using that balance to complete a purchase entirely on that card. </p>
					<p> First, you have to know the exact amount you have on. I don&#039;t have a credit card but have these 2 x $75 each prepaid visa credit cards so i thought i might as well use those. This may not work for you, but i shop on amazon a lot, so whenever i find myself with small value visa gift cards i just buy amazon gift cards. Just check to make sure there isn&#039;t a limit. We are currently able to enter only one gift card at a time. </p>
					<p> Other than my chuckle, neither the cashier nor i cared. Amazon is a store that sells almost anything, so it&#039;s an incredibly popular place to receive gift cards for. You can still use the money to do that. You will find both physical and virtual bias gift cards alongside gift cards from over 800 stores including starbucks, target, home depot, ebay and amazon. That way i can easily spend every single cent without getting stuck with $1.02 or. </p>
					<p> The only one that may have been annoyed by this was the person waiting patiently behind me. Although spending the money is maybe the easiest thing a person can do, it also can be a good source for funding your paypal balance. Gift cards are pretty common to get these days from a ton of different sources like ecommerce sites, gift websites, and local stores. It also requires you to have an amazon account and spend the remainder of your balance on amazon. If regular visa pp cards, try loading to your amazon balance first. </p>
					<p> They can be used to make multiple purchases everywhere visa is accepted, unlike other gift cards that are used only at specific stores. Maybe the gift card you got isn’t just enough to buy the laptop you’re planning for; Most of the other options will cost you some money. This trick allows you to combine and consolidate small balances left on your amex gift cards (it works for visa and mastercard too). You might need to consolidate them first, </p>
					<p> First, choose a big brand. In addition, merchants anticipate that people may receive several gift cards and combine them for a large purchase, pasinli noted. One way to convert visa gift cards to cash is to use them like cash. Gift cards, on the other hand, don’t require avs or cvv (card verification value), so it’s easier for online merchants to accept them alongside a credit card, rather than multiple credit cards. I&#039;d be happy to provide some more details about how many can be used when shopping in our stores and online. </p>
					<p> If you have a collection of walmart gift cards you wish to combine to pay for a single large purchase, remember: One card had $50 and and the other had just 77 cents on it. Card information is provided by third parties. You can redeem up to 15 gift cards per transaction in store and 10 gift cards per transaction at bestbuy.com. Visa gift cards are thoughtful gifts anyone can enjoy. </p>
					<p> However, you may find yourself with not enough of a balance left to buy everything you want, and wonder if multiple cards can be chained together. Many gc&#039;s need to be registered first before shopping online. The most important thing to know about using a gift card online is that you enter the visa gift card number into the debit or credit card payment field rather than a gift card field. Although you cannot combine the balances on your various visa gift cards onto one gift card, you can pay with more than one funding source. This method is slightly complicated, but can always work as a great solution to combine all your visa gift cards. </p>
					<p> Various banks and financial institutions issue the visa gift cards with their own brands featured on the card. Perhaps they&#039;re limited to shopping at certain stores/places only (happy, mall gift cards, etc). It would be nice if there were “combine gift card apps” that would let you combine balances from a few different cards into one bigger balance that you could use to shop with, but sadly that’s not an option. And if you have other types of prepaid cards (such as visa gift. Give them out as gifts. </p>
					<p> Use a reloadable card to pay bills, shop online &amp; access your money anytime. The perfect present in just a few taps. As hockeycanuckjc mentioned, we can process multiple gift cards at once. Even worse, you may be left with only a dollar or two left on the card, and tempted to just. A common gift in the us is gift cards, unfortunately they are a big pain to spend the exact amount. </p>
					<p> Consumers with a visa gift card can use it for purchases at any stores or online merchants that accept visa. (the gift card field is for the store’s branded gift cards, not for open loop gift cards.) so if the dollar value of transaction is greater than the dollar. A smart gift anyone can appreciate. After entering a gift card, the entry field goes away. Most stores let you use multiple gift cards and combine them with another payment (such as another visa prepaid card or credit card). </p>
					<p> Then your gift card balance will automatically be reloaded with the exact balance you previously had on your visa gift card. So now i&#039;m looking to combine the 2 cards into a $150 prepaid visa card. As such if you do choose to do this, perhaps combine it with some of the other options on this list. If you are entering the gift card into the correct field on the website, then it is possible the gift card is being rejected for another reason. Nov 16, 2017 at 19:09 @ttt i think it partially depends. </p>
					<p> We would like the entry field to remain so multiple gift cards can be entered. Visa gift cards are available in varying amounts, offered by each provider. </p>
